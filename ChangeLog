	* main.cc: Only root process outputs the final field data and
	computes derived fields.

	* sparse.h (sparse_entry): Removed unused is_same_place() member
	function.

2013-12-26  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* configure.ac: improvements: check for C++11 compiler; check for
	Boost headers; don't have automatic dependencies any longer; check
	for MPI, PETSc and SLEPc; make sure that slepc and arpack aren't
	selected simultaneously, and at least one is selected.

2013-12-22  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* solver_slepc.cc: Started to write code for interfacing to SLEPc
	solver (thanks to Henry Wu for doing some initial experiments with
	his pwgms3d-1.3).

	* wgms3d.cc, solver.h, solver_superlu_arpack.cpp: Moved the old
	SuperLU/ARPACK-specific stuff from wgms3d.cc to
	solver_superlu_arpack.cpp, and introduced an intermediate
	interface (ISolverResult).

	* main.cc: printing Boost diagnostic information for exceptions
	caught in main().

	* Started to improve C++ code quality all over the place. Not
	listing all the details here, since it's too much.

2013-09-22  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v1.2.2.

	* complex_functions.h: Some helper functions for dealing with
	complex numbers, extracted from fortran_interfaces.h so that the
	template definition order is correct.

2012-07-04  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* mgp.cc: Fixed handling of comment lines (those starting with a
	hash sign).

2012-07-03  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* NOTES: Added a text file with some (unsorted) notes on the
	general design of the program and its data structures.

	* sparse.h: Removed several unused class methods.

2012-06-27  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* tests/: Renamed 2005_JSTQE_Prkna -> disk_resonator,
	2009_PTL_Nguyen -> tm2te_leakage, 2006_OPEX_Dulkeith ->
	silicon_strip_waveguide.

2012-06-18  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* main.cc: this file now implements the shell interface to the new
	wgms3d C++ class.

	* Re-organized and cleaned up the source code to make it easier to
	use wgms3d in other programs. Global (static) variables have been
	removed completely. Everything is now encapsulated in C++ classes.

2012-06-13  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Makefile.am (wgms3d_CPPFLAGS): Removed -Wno-deprecated (which
	was only required for ext/hash_map), replaced with -std=c++0x.

	* diffops.cc: Replaced the use of the GNU extension ext/hash_map
	by unordered_map from C++11 / TR1.

2012-06-07  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Enabled exportation of derived fields (Er, Ez, Ep, Hp) in
	semi-vectorial mode. Printing error and terminating if derived
	fields are requested in scalar mode.

	* matlab/wgms3d_normalize_mode_field.m: New function. Normalizes a
	given mode field with respect to the usual power-normalization
	integral.

	* tests/semivectorial/semivectorial.m: New test script. Compares
	full-vectorial (exact) and semi-vectorial (approximate) modes in a
	waveguide at different wavelengths.

2012-06-06  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* wgms3d.cc (eigensolve): Asking user to contact the author when
	DNAUPD fails. In very rare cases (but then reproducibly), ARPACK's
	dnaupd fails with IDO=99, INFO=-8. I don't have any cases for the
	current wgms3d, but it happened with earlier versions.

2012-02-27  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* tests/2006_OPEX_Dulkeith/m05_calc_neffs.m: Using
	wgms3d_mgp_rib_waveguide() instead of custom script now.

	* matlab/wgms3d_mgp_rib_waveguide.m: Can now generate strip
	waveguides or "photonic wires". Just set the etch depth D to the
	same value as the central rib height H. Also added some
	consistency checks.

2011-11-09  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* configure.ac: Added F77_FUNC(dcopy,DCOPY)(); to the SuperLU and
	ARPACK test scripts to work around linker trouble on my system
	(Ubuntu 11.10).

2011-07-25  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* matlab/wgms3d_plot_refractive_index.m: Load 'epsis.bin' instead
	of 'epsis.txt'.

2011-06-22  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v1.1.0.

2011-06-21  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* tests/2009_PTL_Nguyen/nguyen_prepfunc.m: Using
	wgms3d_mgp_rib_waveguide now.

	* matlab/wgms3d_tracemodes_update_parameter.m: Added this script,
	it was missing in the previous release.

	* matlab/wgms3d_mgp_rib_waveguide.m: New function to generate an
	MGP file describing a rib waveguide. See
	tests/lossy_materials/lossy.m for usage.

	* tests/lossy_materials/lossy.m: Verify lossy-material
	implementation by comparing against the standard perturbation
	result for the modal attenuation caused by slightly lossy
	materials.

	* matlab/wgms3d_load_mode_field.m: Import epsis.bin instead of
	epsis.txt now.

	* matlab/wgms3d_plot_mgp.m: Updated to handle MGP-format extension
	for complex refractive indices.

	* mgp.cc (init_geometry): Updated to use std::ifstream instead of
	fopen() / fscanf(), thus handling complex refractive indices now.

2011-06-20  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Throughout the program: treat epsilon_r = n^2 as a complex
	value, no other changes.

	* wgms3d.cc (initmatrix): Exporting epsis.bin (containing complex
	entries) instead of epsis.txt with real entries now.

2011-06-01  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* matlab/wgms3d_calc_group_index.m: Calculates the group index of
	a mode from its field distribution.

	* matlab/wgms3d_load_mode_field.m: Also importing 'epsis.txt' now,
	if it exists.

2011-05-31  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v1.0.2.

	* wgms3d.cc (main): Output warning when using scalar computation
	mode in conjunction with PMLs or non-zero waveguide curvature. I
	haven't verified this yet.

	* mgp.cc (init_geometry): Output warning when mgp file specifies
	elliptical interfaces (haven't yet found the time to check whether
	they really work okay).

2011-05-23  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* tests/2005_JSTQE_Prkna/bendit.m, tests/2009_PTL_Nguyen/main.m:
	Updated to use wgms3d_tracemodes.m.

	* matlab/wgms3d_tracemodes_plotneffs.m: New helper script.

	* matlab/wgms3d_tracemodes.m: General-purpose mode-tracing
	function, adapted from tests/2009_PTL_Nguyen/tracemodes.m

2011-05-20  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* tests/fiber_convergence/lpmodes.m: Test for convergence of LP
	straight fiber modes (tests scalar computation mode).

	* matlab/wgms3d_plot_scalar.m: New function to plot scalar mode
	fields.

	* wgms3d.cc (main): Added scalar computation mode (command-line
	switch "-p").

	* diffops.cc (make_curv_interface_matrix): When we are in scalar
	mode, pretend the refractive-index contrast D is zero, keep only
	those terms in the interface equations that are proportional to
	D * n_-^2 = n_+^2 - n_-^2.

2011-02-16  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v1.0.1.

	* matlab/wgms3d_run.m: If wgms3d fails, return an empty cell
	array {} instead of throwing a fatal error.

	* wgms3d.cc, matlab/*.m: For consistency reasons, exported
	discretization grids are called 'r.txt' and 'z.txt' now. Same with
	variable names x -> r, y -> z. Update your scripts.

	* Code cleanup: consistently rename variable names containing 'x'
	and 'y' to 'r' (rho) and 'z', respectively, in accordance with the
	notation in my JLT paper; declaring some member functions and
	arguments constant.

2011-02-15  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* tests/2009_PTL_Nguyen/: New test. Reproduces results from Fig. 4
	of Thach G. Nguyen, Ravi S. Tummidi, Thomas L. Koch, Arnan
	Mitchell, "Rigorous Modeling of Lateral Leakage Loss in SOI
	Thin-Ridge Waveguides and Couplers", IEEE Photonics Technology
	Letters, vol. 21, no. 7, April 2009.

	* diffops.cc (make_curv_interface_matrix), Makefile.am: Removed
	automatically generated interface equations. Now explicitly
	implementing the hand-made interface equations as they are printed
	in the JLT paper.

	* mgp.cc: Removed extra code for handling circular
	interfaces. This is now handled as a special case of an elliptical
	interface.

	* tests/fiber_convergence/: Test for convergence of the effective
	indices of a circular step-index fiber (produces the results of
	Fig. 3 from the paper).

2011-02-14  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* fortran_interface.h: Removed some unused functions.

	* matlab/wgms3d_import_output.m: The sgetl() function was
	missing. Fixed. (Thanks to Ivano Giuntoni for reporting this).

	* diffops.cc (make_curv_interface_matrix): Using std::fabs()
	instead of abs().

2011-02-09  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* bezier.cc (bezier_find_line_intersections): Can handle simple
	and interpolated 3-point Bézier curves now.

2011-02-08  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v1.0.0.

	* ghostpoints.cc, ghostpoints.h: Cleaned up. This file now
	contains code for handling ghost points and discretization points
	where the field is known to be zero in advance (either due to
	semi-vectorial computation or due to Dirichlet boundary
	conditions).

	* wgms3d.h: New file, defining some global variables that need to
	be visible to other parts of the code.

	* diffops.cc, diffops.h: Cleaned up. Contains the implementation
	of Chiang's Taylor-expansion process and the boundary conditions.

	* geometry.h: New file, contains definitions of Point, Interval
	and Rect. Cleaned up.

2011-02-07  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* bezier.cc, bezier.h: Completely new code for finding
	intersections of the Taylor-expansion ray with Bézier curves. This
	one is based on solving the resulting (quartic) polynomial using a
	recursive bisection algorithm whose implementation by Per Vognsen
	<vognsen@frost.slimy.com> I found on
	http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Polynomial_Root-Finder.shtml. However,
	I modified the latter to concentrate on zeros in the
	interval [0,1] only, and adapted the tolerances for our
	purposes. This is now much more robust than the old lib2geom code.

2011-01-27  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.8.9.

2011-01-25  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* mgp.cc (get_ifdata): For Bézier curves, calculate tangent vector
	and curvature using the easily calculated first- and second-order
	hodographs of the Bézier curves and the standard formula for the
	curvature of parameterized curves. (Turns out that the curvatures
	calculated this way are more accurate than those returned by the
	earlier lib2geom implementation with the standard tolerances).

	* bezier.h (bezier_valueAt): New function, evaluates Bézier curve.

	* bezier.h: Code stolen from lib2geom snapshot 20101112. This is
	the minimum required for find_intersections() to work. No
	functional changes so far, but this simplifies installation of
	wgms3d.

	* configure.ac: Removed dependency on lib2geom.

2011-01-13  Michael Krause  <m.krause@tu-harburg.de>

	* Released v0.8.8 (first public release).
